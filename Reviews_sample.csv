My dog loves the food after I switched him from a pretty decent dog food (kirkland super premium adult chicken formula), but I noticed my dog was licking his paws and was scratching every once in a while on that food. I switched to this food and no more licking his paws, he scratches less, and has a beautiful coat.<br /><br />dogfoodanalysis.com has this as a 6 out of 6 star dog food and it truly is a top end choice.

5,Delightful mint tea as one would expect. Note that each tea bag is NOT individually wrapped; there is one bag inside the box which holds all of the tea bags in a ziploc pouch.

2,"I really wanted this to work...we have had major problems with various critters eating our garden this year...most of our plants have been stripped, nibbled to nubs, dug up, or eaten as seeds.  For certain there are some rabbits, some mice, some birds, chipmunks and lizards involved here to varying degrees.  This just flat didn't help. This was no more effective than sprinkling cayenne, spraying garlic or anything else we've tried.  It's a nice big bottled filled with stinky powder that doesn't do anything more than use up some money that could feed a nice snake for the garden, dog for the yard, or cat to attack visiting rodents.

2,"Blackberry and pomegranate, green tea, and honey sounds like a lovely combination. Unfortunately, none of those flavors come through in this product.<br /><br />Despite a honey and sugar combination being the first ingredient, the artificial sweetener dominates the flavor of this drink. A berry-fruity-acidic flavor is the next most prominent, but if i'd tried this drink blind i don't think i ever would have guessed it was supposed to be blackberry and pomegranate. I couldn't catch the faintest whiff of green tea flavor or honey, no matter how hard i tried.<br /><br />When i made my first glass of this, i probably mixed it too strong. A single packet (two servings) is supposed to go in a 16.9 ounce bottle of water, but i just mixed mine into a glass. It took a fair bit of stirring to get it to dissolve.<br /><br />My first sip was of an overwhelmingly cloying mixture. It was like being punched in the mouth with fake sugar.<br /><br />I poured half the glass out, and refilled with water. Same experience, but more of a slap than a punch. I continued pouring some out and refilling with water, hoping that at some point it would taste less like fake sugar and more like any of the components advertized on the front. Unfortunately, as i diluted it more and more, the acidic generic fruit flavor faded out, while the artificial sweetener stayed strong. Never did green tea or honey visit my tongue.<br /><br />I suppose for a person totally habituated to artificial sweeteners, this product will taste entirely different. However, if you assume based on the fact that 'honey' is featured prominently on the front of the box that this product is naturally sweetened, you're in for a nasty surprise.",real sugar AND fake sugar - the worst of both worlds,1,2,0.5,294,Negative,blackberry pomegranate green tea honey sounds like lovely combination unfortunately none flavors come productbr br despite honey sugar combination first ingredient artificial sweetener dominates flavor drink berryfruityacidic flavor next prominent id tried drink blind dont think ever would guessed supposed blackberry pomegranate couldnt catch faintest whiff green tea flavor honey matter hard triedbr br made first glass probably mixed strong single packet two servings supposed go 169 ounce bottle water mixed mine glass took fair bit stirring get dissolvebr br first sip overwhelmingly cloying mixture like punched mouth fake sugarbr br poured half glass refilled water experience slap punch continued pouring refilling water hoping point would taste less like fake sugar like components advertized front unfortunately diluted acidic generic fruit flavor faded artificial sweetener stayed strong never green tea honey visit tonguebr br suppose person totally habituated artificial sweeteners product taste entirely different however assume based fact honey featured prominently front box product naturally sweetened youre nasty surprise
4,"I really like these instant Starbucks decaf tubes.  They make a pretty good tasting cup of coffee, and are very easy.

5,"I found a brick of Lavazza Crema e Gusto at a local shop some months ago, and tried it in my stovetop espresso maker. For some reason I thought the grind was what I needed (it *does* have a picture of a stovetop machine on it!) but the grind is really very fine, more like what a professional-type machine needs.<br /><br />But this works even in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001DJT7G"">Bialetti Brikka 4-Cup Stovetop Percolator</a> stovetop machine, and generates a beautiful crema. The Brikka really wants a slightly coarser grind, so I have to be *very* careful to put in the coffee with a light touch, and not to pack it down even a tiny bit.<br /><br />The flavor, as others have written, is very rich without being too dark-roasted, with lovely chocolatey notes. Bitterness can come if I overfill the maker so that the coffee is packed too hard, which causes boiling and burning. So care must be taken when using a stovetop maker. But it's truly worth it, because it gives such delicious coffee.","Rich and flavorful - even from the ""wrong"" pot!",11,11,1.0,174,Positive,found brick lavazza crema e gusto local shop months ago tried stovetop espresso maker reason thought grind needed picture stovetop machine grind really fine like professionaltype machine needsbr br works even hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductb0001djt7gbialetti brikka 4cup stovetop percolatora stovetop machine generates beautiful crema brikka really wants slightly coarser grind careful put coffee light touch pack even tiny bitbr br flavor others written rich without darkroasted lovely chocolatey notes bitterness come overfill maker coffee packed hard causes boiling burning care must taken using stovetop maker truly worth gives delicious coffee

5,"I am a fan of spices... No one has what Tabasco has. The healthiest out there. Only 30 mg of salt per spoon. Others not only cannot compete with Tabasco's taste but they have 200 plus mg of salt in each spoon. That is ridiculous amount of salt. Do not need to refrigerate the Tabasco bottle for one year at all so you can leave it outside at room temperature.  I have been using Tabasco for 40 years all over the world. I add <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNS55A"">TABASCO brand Pepper Sauce - Original Red Gallon</a> to all my dishes since it is the spiciest of all.

I add <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNZRKQ"">TABASCO brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce - Gallon</a> to the tortilla pizza that I make with cheese and herring since this is heavier and tastier but not as spicy as the original red or green. I add the green <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNQV2Y"">TABASCO brand Green Jalapeno Pepper Sauce - Gallon</a> with anything that I make with eggs including the egg sandwich in between tortillas since this is the best with eggs.

5,"I love the waffles from this mix; they have an absolute wonderful flavor and texture in my opinion.<br /><br />However, the results are VERY different depending on which waffle maker I use.  I have made these with an old, traditional square grid waffle iron, a light-weight circular ""Belgium"" waffle maker, and a light-weight flip ""Belgium"" waffle maker, and the results were completely ordinary.  It's only after I purchased a heavier-duty flip Belgium style maker did the waffles come out gloriously light, fluffy, with a slight crispy outside:  just perfect for me.<br /><br />The results are also dependent on exactly how thick the batter comes out which depends on the size of the eggs used and on how precisely the water is measured out.  I prefer the waffles when the batter is on the ""runny"" side.  When you fill the waffle maker, a runny batter spreads quite quickly and you actually don't use as much batter per waffle.  You can still see the black parts of the ""insides"" of the grids of the waffle maker poking through the batter when you go to close the maker.

5,"Love this formula. All of the nutrition, none of the ridiculous crap.<br />My son started to self-wean around 8 months, which was devastating for me since I know the wonderful benefits of human milk for human babies. I researched a TON--from goat's milk, to raw milk, to every formula under the sun. This was the best option I could find. The ease of not having to refrigerate it, combined with it being the closest to human milk as you can get--even down to tasting slightly sweet. Yes, I tasted it.<br />I love that they have a lactose-free option that isn't soy. Soy mimics estrogen and should not be fed to infant boys. Or girls, for that matter.<br />It does tend to be foamy when you shake it up, but we just scooped it off with a spoon--no biggie. Even if we didn't remove the foam, son didn't get gassy from it.<br />I know it says it's a Toddler Formula for 12 months and up, but that is because the company is a proponent of breastfeeding for the first year.

Also starring Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin, two actors you would have never thought to put together in a movie of this genre, it is classic comedy at its best.

4,"I'm going to preface this review by saying that my kitties are not picky about food. We've made sure to expose them to a variety of dry and wet foods since they were very young, and they are usually willing to try new things. That being said, they loved this food and took to it with no problems at all. I mixed it 50/50 with their old food (a mid-range name brand), but I didn't even need to.<br /><br />I compared the ingredients and guaranteed analysis in Premium Edge to our current dry food, Purina One Hairball and also Taste of the Wild which I was considering purchasing as well. I found the ingredients in Premium Edge much better than Purina and, in my opinion, even a smidge better than Taste of the Wild. For example, PE's first 4 ingredients are: Chicken, chicken meal, peas, egg product (also a good source of protein for kitties). ToW's first 4 ingredients are: Chicken meal, peas, sweet potatoes, chicken fat. Purina's are: Chicken, corn gluten meal, brewers rice, poultry by-product meal. No comparison there. I'd much rather feed my cats a dry food that at least has some ""real"" chicken in it, although chicken meal isn't as bad as some people think it is -- it's just ground up meat and other bits like bone and tissue (which they would eat in a wild or raw diet anyway!) Then there's the guaranteed analysis to consider. More protein is always better, since cats are obligate carnivores and would not eat carbs if they had their choice. PE wins with 45% protein, followed by Tow at 42% then Purina One with only 34%.<br /><br />And finally price... Price per pound based on Amazon price: Premium Edge 18 lb. bag was $1.46/lb., ToW 15 lb. bag was $2.26/lb., and Purina One was $1.59/lb. for 16 lb. bag. So again, Premium Edge came out on top. This is what I will be buying from now on, until I finally bite the bullet and move my brood to a wet food only or a full-on raw food diet.","Product Comparison - Premium wins on Ingredients, Analysis and Price!",1,1,1.0,350,Positive,im going preface review saying kitties picky food weve made sure expose variety dry wet foods since young usually willing try new things said loved food took problems mixed 5050 old food midrange name brand didnt even need tobr br compared ingredients guaranteed analysis premium edge current dry food purina one hairball also taste wild considering purchasing well found ingredients premium edge much better purina opinion even smidge better taste wild example pes first 4 ingredients chicken chicken meal peas egg product also good source protein kitties tows first 4 ingredients chicken meal peas sweet potatoes chicken fat purinas chicken corn gluten meal brewers rice poultry byproduct meal comparison id much rather feed cats dry food least real chicken although chicken meal isnt bad people think ground meat bits like bone tissue would eat wild raw diet anyway theres guaranteed analysis consider protein always better since cats obligate carnivores would eat carbs choice pe wins 45 protein followed tow 42 purina one 34br br finally price price per pound based amazon price premium edge 18 lb bag 146lb tow 15 lb bag 226lb purina one 159lb 16 lb bag premium edge came top buying finally bite bullet move brood wet food fullon raw food diet

The can says it is 100% juice--no sugar added and no preservatives--100% RDA vitamin C--all natural, no artificial colors and gluten free.  (Gluten free is a big deal to those with gluten intolerance, like one of my girlfriends.) 8.3 fl oz  can/245 ml.  Calories in the entire can 130.  Sodium 15mg, carbs 35mg, sugars 33g.  As you know, there is a certain amount of natural sugar in fruits anyway.  Ingredients (in order listed) are:100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates), apple, grape, acerola and cherry juice concentrates, natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C).<br /><br />Quite a nice taste and I am pretty picky.  I don't generally drink sodas or any carbonated beverages any more.  I try to consume mostly healthy products. This is really pretty good tasting and a decent alternative to a soda, especially for a child's lunchbox.  It actually seems to taste even better as you drink more of it, too.

4,"The Spaghetti with Turkey Meatballs is better than many others in the Hormel line in some respects and worse in others. My biggest complaint about the Hormel red pasta sauces is that they are all unfailingly too sweet and have a distracting acidic tang to it. This one, thankfully, doesn't have these issues at all. It is a very nice tasting sauce (a little bland but that's par for the course with this type of meal produced to be enjoyed by many different types of people) that pretty much makes the entire dish. The noodles are noodles. Nothing exceptional, nothing horrible. It's the meatballs where this meal fails. I understand that they are attempting to make a lower calorie meal and applaud their efforts but these turkey meatballs are terrible. They are overly dry and have pretty much no taste. Maybe if the meat was ground up and mixed into the sauce, this wouldn't be an issue but instead they are in fairly large chunks.<br /><br />As a whole though, I would rather eat this meal than many, many others in the Hormel line up. It still has way too much sodium (600mg) but comparing that to some of the other meals (upwards of 1300mg) it's much, much better. If you're looking for something that doesn't have to be refrigerated, is quick and easy to heat up, and is fairly palatable, you really can't go wrong with this one. Just cut up the meatballs first and mix it in with the rest. It'll be much better that way.",One of the better Hormel meals,1,2,0.5,258,Positive,spaghetti turkey meatballs better many others hormel line respects worse others biggest complaint hormel red pasta sauces unfailingly sweet distracting acidic tang one thankfully doesnt issues nice tasting sauce little bland thats par course type meal produced enjoyed many different types people pretty much makes entire dish noodles noodles nothing exceptional nothing horrible meatballs meal fails understand attempting make lower calorie meal applaud efforts turkey meatballs terrible overly dry pretty much taste maybe meat ground mixed sauce wouldnt issue instead fairly large chunksbr br whole though would rather eat meal many many others hormel line still way much sodium 600mg comparing meals upwards 1300mg much much better youre looking something doesnt refrigerated quick easy heat fairly palatable really cant go wrong one cut meatballs first mix rest itll much better way

5,Green tea can be very bitter especially if you brew it too long. This tea brews quickly and has a very pure taste and delicate aroma. I like drinking each cup with a packet of stevia. It seems to sweeten it just enough without masking the subtle silky flavors. This tea is made of rare white tea and green tea. White tea actually has more antioxidants than green tea and has less caffeine. So this particluar tea is very healthy.

1,"My kitten--now a hefty 11 pound slug--went through the same antics as the 1-star review written about Bean.<br /><br />I couldn't figure out why our Tiki was always hungry.  Why she got fat and lazy and was always panting, but never too satiated to turn up her nose at Science Diet.  She was always begging for it, every 4 hours.  And her litter-box smells, and the size of the poos--I swear, they were human-size!  I thought okay, she's a growing kitten, she must know more than I do about her nutritional needs, so I kept filling the bowl.  But she got so huge so fast that I knew something was wrong.<br /><br />So I did my research and learned all about sub-standard pet food, and what cats really need. It's not Science Diet, that's for sure!  Yet our local pound where I adopted Tiki insisted on keeping her on Science Diet, because ""it's good for the cats and they love it"". Hmmm.<br /><br />I began weaning our Tiki off Science Diet about 2 months ago.  It has been a long and tortuous change for both of us.  I have to put up with pitiful meowing all hours of the night.  Unfortunately I have to keep a small bag of Science Diet in the pantry (long story short: our other emaciated cat Tonga needs to have a small amount of Science Diet mixed in with her good Evo food to ""fatten her up"" with empty calories).<br /><br />You should see Tiki when she comes anywhere near the Science Diet bag of food.  She goes nuts, literally.  She yanks at the bag, tries to rip it open, drags it around the house in her teeth...one time she even bit through some plastic water bottles to try to get behind them and attack the Science Diet.<br /><br />When we began this process 2 months ago I switched to Innova Evo (timed feeding) along with various expensive wet foods, freely fed.  Evo is great for the cats (though Tonga, already a sleek looking cheetah-wannabee) lost weight on it; hence, the need to augment her food with fattening, empty-cal Science Diet.  On strictly Evo and wet food  our Tiki, too, has lost weight, but it has been gradual, as I can't do it too fast, because she is still a growing kitten at 10 months.<br /><br />Sorry for the jumble of writing, but you get the point: NO to Science Diet.","Science Diet = terrible for cats, it's addictive",5,6,0.8333333333333334,406,Negative,kittennow hefty 11 pound slugwent antics 1star review written beanbr br couldnt figure tiki always hungry got fat lazy always panting never satiated turn nose science diet always begging every 4 hours litterbox smells size poosi swear humansize thought okay shes growing kitten must know nutritional needs kept filling bowl got huge fast knew something wrongbr br research learned substandard pet food cats really need science diet thats sure yet local pound adopted tiki insisted keeping science diet good cats love hmmmbr br began weaning tiki science diet 2 months ago long tortuous change us put pitiful meowing hours night unfortunately keep small bag science diet pantry long story short emaciated cat tonga needs small amount science diet mixed good evo food fatten empty caloriesbr br see tiki comes anywhere near science diet bag food goes nuts literally yanks bag tries rip open drags around house teethone time even bit plastic water bottles try get behind attack science dietbr br began process 2 months ago switched innova evo timed feeding along various expensive wet foods freely fed evo great cats though tonga already sleek looking cheetahwannabee lost weight hence need augment food fattening emptycal science diet strictly evo wet food tiki lost weight gradual cant fast still growing kitten 10 monthsbr br sorry jumble writing get point science diet

We recently purchased this for our 8 month old French Bulldog after our trainer suggested feeding him by hand to prevent him from gobbling up his meals in 2 seconds as Frenchies do.

We tried several Kong type products and he was able to either get his food out too quickly or grew bored and never ate. This toy makes him really work for his food and because he can see the food through the tube it really keeps his interest. My only gripe is that the plastic tube could be more sturdy. I love that it's see through but his jaws of steel have already done some damage to it, but perhaps we just need to experiment with a larger size (we have the small now) We've only had it a short time so I can't speak too much for longevity but for now it is an amazing solution.",Amazing toy for dogs who devour their food quickly,1,1,1.0,175,Positive,absolutely love toy recently purchased 8 month old french bulldog trainer suggested feeding hand prevent gobbling meals 2 seconds frenchies thats great theory many times cant sit feed kibble bit bit tried several kong type products able either get food quickly grew bored never ate toy makes really work food see food tube really keeps interest gripe plastic tube could sturdy love see jaws steel already done damage perhaps need experiment larger size small weve short time cant speak much longevity amazing solution

I've tried all three of the available flavors and can't seem to choose a favorite.<br /><br />The Citrus with Vitamin C flavor reviewed here is definitely pretty awesome. The gum has the physical profile of an old-school Chicklet. It definitely has a serious citrus taste profile, though I guess that there might be a slight strawberry backbone in there somewhere. But boy, does this gum LAST. I can usually go a good 3-4 hours and still get some flavor out of this stuff. That makes it a good value in my book for sure.<br /><br />Typically retails for around $1.39/pack at my local grocer, although I've caught it on sale for under a dollar once or twice.

We also notice less year round shedding and just deal with the seasonal coat blow. He is a finicky eater, but always excited for mealtime on Dogswell food. He also used to scratch and lick his one leg raw in spots. Once we started Dogswell,his itches and rashes never came back.

These were very good also, even better in my opinion. I do buy and roast my own fresh chestnuts occasionally so I know what they are like fresh. Here is what I found with Galil foil sealed chestnut types.  The shelled ones taste good, a tiny bit sweeter then the ones with the shell (not much thou). The shelled ones were smaller in size then the ones with shell after shelling (about 30% smaller). Again not a problem. The shelled ones were a bit moister (my one daughter preferred the moistness,not me). Fresh roasted are never that moist. Again this may not be a problem for you. Now, the ones with the shell on in my opinion are better as they taste closer to real roasted fresh chestnuts. The shell ones have the more dry in the mouth texture like fresh (but not exactly). All in all I like the ones with the shell better (closer to the fresh roasted). OH YA the shells come off pretty easy on most, a few are harder but well worth the extra work.

5,"I started buying Skippy several years ago after reading a number of consumer reviews that gave it a top ranking. The one that stuck with me the most was a polling of 12 year-olds, who gave Skippy peanut butter a resounding recommendation for its tastes and texture. In writing this review, I went back and checked to see what more adult reviewers think. I'm taking the liberty of quoting from the CookingLightly website so far as its review of Creamy:<br /><br />""The roasted peanuts on the ingredient list are evident in the heady aroma and balanced flavor. Testers thought this sample was a touch oily, but spread the best...Makes the perfect peanut butter sandwich, but can turn into a savory dressing when mixed with soy, vinegar, and crushed red pepper to serve over sugar snap peas, broccoli, or a stir-fry. For a sweet version, mix with honey and mayonnaise and use as a fruit salad dressing. Mix with chile paste with garlic (sambal oelek) or sriracha for an easy sauce for roast meats.""<br /><br />This is my opinion, too, and while the above review was for the regular Creamy, it applies in my opinion to the reduced fat version just as well. I love this peanut butter. I know that Jif and Peter Pan are also often ranked highly, but Skippy is by far my preference.<br /><br />While I use it on sandwiches, I often just eat a tablespoon or two as a quick snack and source of protein. It is so good in this role that I gave it to a diabetic friend. She uses it in lieu of orange juice if she's starting to feel hypoglycemic. The peanut butter stays with her longer and has a smoother effect.<br /><br />I will note that some nutritionists are now raising questions abou he value of reduced fat peanut butter. They have two ASIC points:<br /><br />1. The process of removing fat is n fact removing monounsaturated oils which are healthy for us.<br /><br />2. To compensate for any loss of taste, manufacturers are putting back in sugars and oils which may not e so healthy.<br /><br />My rating is based on taste and texture. I'm not taking a position in nutritional debates but do suggest that you check these matters out separately if you are concerned about this kind of issue.",Top of the line so far as reduced fat peanut butters,0,0,0.0,391,Positive,started buying skippy several years ago reading number consumer reviews gave top ranking one stuck polling 12 yearolds gave skippy peanut butter resounding recommendation tastes texture writing review went back checked see adult reviewers think im taking liberty quoting cookinglightly website far review creamybr br roasted peanuts ingredient list evident heady aroma balanced flavor testers thought sample touch oily spread bestmakes perfect peanut butter sandwich turn savory dressing mixed soy vinegar crushed red pepper serve sugar snap peas broccoli stirfry sweet version mix honey mayonnaise use fruit salad dressing mix chile paste garlic sambal oelek sriracha easy sauce roast meatsbr br opinion review regular creamy applies opinion reduced fat version well love peanut butter know jif peter pan also often ranked highly skippy far preferencebr br use sandwiches often eat tablespoon two quick snack source protein good role gave diabetic friend uses lieu orange juice shes starting feel hypoglycemic peanut butter stays longer smoother effectbr br note nutritionists raising questions abou value reduced fat peanut butter two asic pointsbr br 1 process removing fat n fact removing monounsaturated oils healthy usbr br 2 compensate loss taste manufacturers putting back sugars oils may e healthybr br rating based taste texture im taking position nutritional debates suggest check matters separately concerned kind issue

4,"I really enjoy the distinct flavor of this Tazo. I prefer the straight green teas, rather than those with other flavorings added (except for the delicious Genmai Cha with toasted rice).  I've been trying a variety of Japanese green teas, including Sencha, and some brands have been high in quality and flavor.  But they have been weaker-tasting than this one, too, which has disappointed me.  I find that most Chinese green teas tend to have a smokier or not as bright flavor, and are sometimes not even green in color.  Although labeled ""China"", this Tazo looks and tastes more like a grassier Japanese-style green tea.  I've read that fluoride levels in green teas, particularly those from China, can be pretty high, and I don't think this Tazo green is organic either.  Some teas labeled ""Japanese"" are actually harvested in China.  I noticed many green teas advertised here do not mention where the tea comes from.  It's a concern, though not a deal-breaker, and I'm still looking for a real Japanese green tea that matches the flavor strength of this one, as well as the reasonable price.","Very good flavor, more like a Japanese-style green",1,2,0.5,186,Positive,really enjoy distinct flavor tazo prefer straight green teas rather flavorings added except delicious genmai cha toasted rice ive trying variety japanese green teas including sencha brands high quality flavor weakertasting one disappointed find chinese green teas tend smokier bright flavor sometimes even green color although labeled china tazo looks tastes like grassier japanesestyle green tea ive read fluoride levels green teas particularly china pretty high dont think tazo green organic either teas labeled japanese actually harvested china noticed many green teas advertised mention tea comes concern though dealbreaker im still looking real japanese green tea matches flavor strength one well reasonable price

5,"I discovered this coffee 6 years ago while on a trip to Maryland where our hostess served it at breakfast. I thought it was brewed and was surprised to see the jar in her hand as she made more. I had stopped brewing coffee at home because a) finding good brew coffee is hit or miss, b) finding a good coffee maker is expensive and hit or miss, c) it's a waste of coffee when brewing for one, and d) it involves too much cleanup. Taster's Choice was just what I needed: a great tasting coffee that I could make just enough of for one and not have to clean up much of anything. A perfect storm of great taste and convenience.<br /><br />I began with the original roast (loved it but eventually needed a stronger aroma) and graduated to the Gourmet (dark) roast that they are now calling French roast. It tastes like and has the aroma of great brewed coffee. There's nothing else like it on the grocery shelves. I've tried the others and they're not even in the same class as this ""instant"" coffee. To call it instant is misleading. ""Instant"" is a pejorative in coffee world and Taster's Choice deserves better. This roast is strong, robust, and can be bitter if you use too much.

1,"I really was surprised at how bad this stuff really was.  When I ordered it I figured with ingredients like ginger and lemon that it would make a satisfying hot wintertime drink.  But alas it was downright terrible. I heated the right amount of water as per its directions and found it extremely strong and bitter.  So I added more water and mix and this time added some honey for flavor and still found it too strong, and very unsatisfying.  Finally I cut it with extra water and that was all she wrote, it was still bad.  Worse I feel than the taste of this stuff when actually drinking it was the terrible aftertaste that lasts for some time.  An hour later I could still taste some of it lingering, and it was not at all pleasant.

1,"I used Fresh Step cat litter for many years and was quick to tell any of my cat owner friends that it was the best ""bang for the buck"" litter. It clumped hard, making the chore of cleaning the cat box a relatively easy one. Sometime around 6 months ago, that all changed. Now, it forms a sludge in the cat box that is nearly impossible to scrape out. The amount of effort necessary to clean the box could easily induce a muscle strain or hernia for those unfortunate enough to purchase this litter. Interestingly, after having this experience (twice, because I thought maybe I just got a bad batch the first time) I turned to Scoop Away which I always considered to be a similarly good product, only to find the exact same thing.

5,"I'd been reading about the health benefits of eating pure, unadulterated coconut oil, and found that the little jars in the supermarket were just too expensive. So my search lead me to Amazon for quantity, price and purity. I looked at many options here, and found this one. For me, the taste is a plus, but some might find it a problem. It has a fairly obvious coconut flavor to it, so if you are picky about flavors added to the food you are cooking, this could be a problem for you. I haven't found it to be a problem, myself. My wife won't cook with it because she is generally not looking to add a coconut flavor to most of what she adds oil to. I find that it is even a good flavor if I should occasionally choose to eat a tablespoon of oil directly. At room temperature, (at least during the winter) the oil is solid, and it melts in my mouth. It has a nice smooth texture, with that coconut taste. The color is nice white, like the inside of a coconut. It is supposed to be stable at higher temperatures. I believe it provides a good supply of the Omega-3 fatty acids, which I understand a lot of us may not get enough of. (We tend to get too much of the Omega-6.) I read of a low-carb recipe for chocolate lard, and thought it would work well with this coconut oil instead of lard. (Haven't tried it yet.)

5,"The BFF line is great; my cats adore it (to the point of occasionally going on food strike when I try to get them to eat other things), its fairly reasonably priced and aside from the mercury issues, it's a really healthy catfood lacking all the crud that's usually in commercially prepared foods (bad additives, grains, corn etc).<br /><br />This particular flavor (tuna and shrimp) is their favorite, but I also feed the tuna and pumpkin flavor which is a close second.  The only reason that I don't feed this 100% of the time, is because just like with humans, you have to be a little concerned about the amount of mercury in fish.

5,"I tried Switch Orange Tangerine drink.  Excellent flavor and not so sweet as to make you feel you are getting a ton of sugar.  It has no added sugar and no corn sweetners, so, it is more natural than any other orange soda type drink.  More like a sparkling juice drink.  I have been a fan of orange juice and soda type drinks when as a kid I would mix OJ and Orange Soda.  Yet the natural taste of this drink is refreshing.  I tried it both with and without ice and although the iced version is more refreshing, if you get a very cold can of this drink it tasted very satisfying and did not leave you with an after taste or with the sugar blues.<br /><br />Caution, it has 34 grams of sugar, and although natural, you should check with a doc if you have sugar problems.  34 grams is equivalent to 5 or more teaspoons of sugar.

4,"I called the company and got a detailed explanation of everything that was commented  on in the other reviews.  The company spent a great deal of time with me explaining the below and seemed sincere.<br /><br />CHANGE FROM NEW ZEALAND TO US<br /><br />The majority of their customer base was primarily attracted to the naturally occurring 8.0 alkaline water, and had an issue with water being trucked half way around the world.  Most of the customers wanted a similar quality water with less of an environmental impact.  So the company made the business decision to follow this feedback and invested a great deal of effort finding three natural springs in the US that are naturally alkaline.  Water from New Zealand is no long available.<br /><br />The sources and the water quality report from the new US based springs can be found on their site.<br />[...]<br /><br />DISTILLED WATER<br /><br />During this time an unfortunate mishap happened regarding an order of specially requested water by a department store.  This department store requested distilled water.  The bottles were labeled differently, but the cases looked the same and unfortunately some of this water wound up being distributed by mistake.  The company states they will never create another lot of distilled water and while they regret that this water has hit the market in some areas, it is of limited supply and the issue should dissipate.<br /><br />LABELING<br /><br />The original water that was manufactured in New Zealand, says ""New Zealand"" on the label.  It is no longer being produced.  If you are lucky enough to still be in possession of this water, you have a collector's item.<br /><br />The new US based water, from the three naturally alkaline springs says Source: Multi-Spring, bottled for Eternal Beverages, Walnut Creek CA.  This is the water the company is basing its future on.<br /><br />The distilled water that is out in some markets actually says distilled water on the back of the label.  If you are in possession of this water, you have an inferior product.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL OPINION<br /><br />I happen to be in possession of the original New Zealand water, the new US based spring water, as well as several competing brands: Hawaiian Springs and Mountain Valley Springs.<br /><br />Comparing them by taste and smell, my husband and I agree that this is how we would rate the four products.  1.) New Zealand water is the clear winner, it's a shame we no longer have the option to purchase it, 2.) The US based Eternal Water is our second choice, 3.) Hawaiian Springs is a close second to the US based Eternal Water, 4.) Mountain Valley Spring Water.

4,"These are excellent tasting, especially when fresh.  They are chewy chocolate caramels with a dark chocolate coating that matches perfectly with the chocolate caramel inside (not too dark tasting for me).  They are made in Germany.<br /><br />These individual ""candy bar"" size of Riesens are difficult to find in stores in my area, so I ordered from Amazon.  This product provides a sort of portion control for me, since there are 5 caramels in each package - when I buy a larger bag of individually wrapped Riesens, I tend to eat the whole bag or at least, too much of it.  With this ""candy bar"" size, I am limited to 5 Riesens (or suffer my self-imposed guilt for eating multiple packages).  I also like that it is less packaging, since the 5 Riesens are not individually wrapped, also making them easier to eat.<br /><br />One drawback of this packaging, however, may be that the caramels do not stay as fresh - they were a tiny bit hard at the edges, compared to bags of super soft and chewy individually foil-wrapped Riesens.",Yum,0,0,0.0,181,Positive,excellent tasting especially fresh chewy chocolate caramels dark chocolate coating matches perfectly chocolate caramel inside dark tasting made germanybr br individual candy bar size riesens difficult find stores area ordered amazon product provides sort portion control since 5 caramels package buy larger bag individually wrapped riesens tend eat whole bag least much candy bar size limited 5 riesens suffer selfimposed guilt eating multiple packages also like less packaging since 5 riesens individually wrapped also making easier eatbr br one drawback packaging however may caramels stay fresh tiny bit hard edges compared bags super soft chewy individually foilwrapped riesens

4,"Queen Anne Cordial Blueberries are a recent variation on the more familiar cordial cherries sold in drugstores and grocery stores.  Each chocolate candy contains a good-sized blueberry swimming in the liquid filling instead of a cherry.<br /><br />I have come to prefer the dark chocolate cherry cordials much more than the milk chocolate ones but these blueberry cordials are only available in milk chocolate so they are definitely very sweet!  They are best with a glass of milk or a cup of coffee or tea to go with them.  I enjoy the combination of the blueberry and chocolate and the liquid filling is fun to eat.  Children also like these if you are willing to share but the drips can be messy for the youngest ones.<br /><br />If you have never read about how they get the liquid center into the candy, it is quite interesting.  When they are made, the filling is solid and it becomes liquid over time because of the invertase, an enzyme that changes the sucrose into glucose and fructose.  Bees also use invertase to make honey from nectar.<br /><br />The 5.6 ounce (159 gram) box contains ten candies, each with 60 calories.  They are packed in two sealed trays which will help prevent you from eating all ten cordials at once.  I was worried by the ""artificial flavored"" label but it apparently refers to vanillin with the blueberry flavor being natural.<br /><br />Ingredients:  Sugar, milk chocolate (sugar, cocoa butter, milk, chocolate, soya lecithin, PGPR, and vanillin), blueberries (blueberries, high fructose corn syrup, glycerol, citric acid, calcium lactate, potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, natural blueberry flavor, pectin methyl esterase), corn syrup, dark coating (sugar, partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oils) cocoa, chocolate, soya lecithin), invertase, artificial flavor.",Fun to eat but very sweet!,0,0,0.0,290,Positive,queen anne cordial blueberries recent variation familiar cordial cherries sold drugstores grocery stores chocolate candy contains goodsized blueberry swimming liquid filling instead cherrybr br come prefer dark chocolate cherry cordials much milk chocolate ones blueberry cordials available milk chocolate definitely sweet best glass milk cup coffee tea go enjoy combination blueberry chocolate liquid filling fun eat children also like willing share drips messy youngest onesbr br never read get liquid center candy quite interesting made filling solid becomes liquid time invertase enzyme changes sucrose glucose fructose bees also use invertase make honey nectarbr br 56 ounce 159 gram box contains ten candies 60 calories packed two sealed trays help prevent eating ten cordials worried artificial flavored label apparently refers vanillin blueberry flavor naturalbr br ingredients sugar milk chocolate sugar cocoa butter milk chocolate soya lecithin pgpr vanillin blueberries blueberries high fructose corn syrup glycerol citric acid calcium lactate potassium sorbate sodium benzoate natural blueberry flavor pectin methyl esterase corn syrup dark coating sugar partially hydrogenated soybean cottonseed oils cocoa chocolate soya lecithin invertase artificial flavor

2,"This product is a bit odd, to say the least. It is designed in a roll-on deodorant type of bottle and your dog must lick the rolling ball to enjoy his treat.<br /><br />When first trying to get my dog to try it, he really looked at me, looked at the bottle, looked at me, looked at the bottle etc. You could literally see in his eyes that he was wondering what the heck he was supposed to do, or what I wanted him to do. Finally he took a swipe at it with his tongue. I assume he was unimpressed because he made no effort to go for another lick, despite my encouragement.<br /><br />The whole idea is just weird. I give my dog treats as well..treats, or to reward good behavior, or just to be nice, or to get him to lay/settle down for a little - in other words to keep him busy for a few minutes or so. This type of treat obviously goes against the idea of keeping him occupied for awhile while keeping my time free since you have to sit/stand there and hold the bottle for him. Now, don't get me wrong, we always have a variety of snacks on hand and I would not mind standing there holding this bottle for him if he actually liked the treat. It's just one of those little extra things we do to show our love. However, he just seemed to not like the taste once he did figure out to lick it, otherwise I assume he would have continued to lick.<br /><br />The texture of the liquid inside just looks gross to me. It is a clearish, somewhat dark brown color. Kind of like pancake syrup although not as sticky/tacky.<br /><br />If your dog will lick the roller ball and likes the taste, then I guess it is a good buy, but if not it is obviously a waste.<br /><br />I also cannot help but wonder who sat around and thought ""Hmmmm, let's create a liquid dog treat and put it in a roll-on deodorant dispenser!!""",Somewhat undecided,1,2,0.5,351,Negative,product bit odd say least designed rollon deodorant type bottle dog must lick rolling ball enjoy treatbr br first trying get dog try really looked looked bottle looked looked bottle etc could literally see eyes wondering heck supposed wanted finally took swipe tongue assume unimpressed made effort go another lick despite encouragementbr br whole idea weird give dog treats welltreats reward good behavior nice get laysettle little words keep busy minutes type treat obviously goes idea keeping occupied awhile keeping time free since sitstand hold bottle dont get wrong always variety snacks hand would mind standing holding bottle actually liked treat one little extra things show love however seemed like taste figure lick otherwise assume would continued lickbr br texture liquid inside looks gross clearish somewhat dark brown color kind like pancake syrup although stickytackybr br dog lick roller ball likes taste guess good buy obviously wastebr br also cannot help wonder sat around thought hmmmm lets create liquid dog treat put rollon deodorant dispenser

But of the three packages I've cooked so far, all had a very slight sour taste.  They weren't spoiled in any way, just had a slightly tangy flavor that I don't associate with gnocchi.  It's not noticeable with a red sauce but is with a lighter flavored sauce.  I don't know if this taste is typical of the brand.

This one actually tastes good as normal milk powder does if you ever tasted that, I'm glad I stumbled upon it after getting on the internet and researching the formulas.

4,"My dad got an assortment of these to give as a silly little Christmas gift for us (we are adults now).  I really wasn't expecting much from them, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The flavors are mild, but good tasting and not sickly sweet.  Similarly, the carbonation turns out to have a pleasant effect rather than the gut-busting feeling you get from drinking soda.  I was also happy to see that it is sweetened with sucralose rather than sugar or aspartame.  The only drawback is the sodium content (contained in the compounds that create the carbonation.)  One other thing to note is that one tablet is for 6 ounces of water, so you will likely need to use 2 or 3 tablets for a ""normal"" glass or bottle of water.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say that if you are a soda drinker, you will find these disappointing since the flavors and carbonation are mild.  However, as an alternative to Crystal Lite, Kool-Ade (which I can't stand) or plain water, these are fun and make a good drink.","Fun alternative to soda, water, Crystal Lite, or Kool-Ade",3,3,1.0,176,Positive,dad got assortment give silly little christmas gift us adults really wasnt expecting much pleasantly surprised flavors mild good tasting sickly sweet similarly carbonation turns pleasant effect rather gutbusting feeling get drinking soda also happy see sweetened sucralose rather sugar aspartame drawback sodium content contained compounds create carbonation one thing note one tablet 6 ounces water likely need use 2 3 tablets normal glass bottle waterbr br overall id say soda drinker find disappointing since flavors carbonation mild however alternative crystal lite koolade cant stand plain water fun make good drink

5,"Albeit it's not as good as homemade miso, I find this to be the best instant miso I've tried.  Personally, I don't like super-salty food, so I was thrilled to find the reduced-sodium kind.  This soup is flavorful, and, as another reviewer mentioned, it tastes even better with some dried seaweed added to it.  I use Annie Chun's dried seaweed snacks in the sesame flavor: I rip the snacks into 2 or 3 large pieces, throw it in the bowl with the seasoning, and add hot water - voila!  That also helps for those of you who might like a saltier soup because the seaweed snacks have sea salt sprinkled on them.  If I'm feeling adventurous and have more time, I'll take extra-firm tofu cubes, sear them in a pan with a little olive oil and a bit of the seasoning from the packet, add them to the soup after slightly browned and crispy, and let the soup sit for a bit so the tofu absorbs the flavor.  It's healthy and filling without the parched-tongue after-effect that happens with many super-salty instant miso soups.

(the aforementioned brand takes 3! disks just to fill a regular sized coffee mug.)<br /><br />Being fed-up with that, and seeing that these variety is advertised to make a LARGE size DARK ROAST, I figured I would give these a try.  It fills the cup alright, but the ""coffee"" more closely resembles hot brown water. Thin feeling in your mouth and hardly any flavor at all.<br /><br />Noticing that the effluent from the Tassimo machine appears to be clear water for the last few seconds of the brewing process, I've even tried cutting it short.  That doesn't help either. The coffee just doesn't have any body to it.  It doesn't even have an aroma.<br /><br />That's it Kraft.  You lost me.  I thought you could pull it together and reverse engineer something like the Starbucks coffee (or team up with another strong brand, or fix the contract, or something!) but I am tired of wasting my money while I wait.

1,"These Robbie Dawg snacks have been rejected to the extreme degree by every animal!<br /><br />I bought them originally for a cat whose who loves Temptations snacks. Not only did she not touch these, but when one of these was in her Temptations snack dish, she wouldn't even go near the bowl, as if this snack contaminated all in its vicinity.<br /><br />I next tried it on an outdoors cat who lives in the neighborhood. Since he lives the life of a homeless scavenger, one wouldn't expect him to be picky. Yet not even real hunger would make the bridge for him trying this.<br /><br />All right, how about dogs then? While this was made for cats, my experience is that many dogs will bascially eat anything you hand them (gulp it down first, and ask questions later). Outcome....<br /><br />My neighbor's dog answer: No way. Next two dogs, same answer. One of those dogs I've known for over a decade and this is the very first time she has ever refused anything I've offered her. We left one of these treats on the dining room floor for the evening, and it statyed there all night, until we resigned and threw it in the trash.<br /><br />Also tried it on a pair of rats.

4,"I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.

It's smooth and just sweet enough to remind me of bittersweet chocolate, more than dark.<br /><br />The reason for 4 and not 5 stars has more to do with the price of being environmentally aware.  Perhaps that explains the price hike on this bar of chocolate versus some others?

5,"Let me start this review by saying I'm a bit of an expert on hot sauce.  Maybe not as much as Scott Roberts (of scottrobertsweb.com) but fairly close. I use hot sauce all the time.  I've tried hundreds of brands.  And this is easily in my top 5 hot sauces ever.  It might even take the #1 spot, if the hotter version of this, made with fresh scorpion peppers (Cauterizer) did not exist.<br /><br />First, it's hot.  It's not so ungodly hot that I can't run a solid line down my burrito, but it's hot enough where even the most hardcore of chileheads can tell it's hot.  It's hot enough to get the job done.  And it's a perfect heat where I can use it with anything.  It is one of the hotter non-extract based sauces out there (which means it should have good flavor -- those who don't know, most extract sauces taste a little chemically and thus lack in flavor).<br /><br />Second, there's flavor which is the most important category.  After all, who wants to eat something that's hot, but doesn't particularly taste good? And flavor is where this sauce excels.  This is a Louisiana style hot sauce with a vinegary base, but the flavor is much more complex than any other Louisiana style hot sauce I have ever had.

2,"This is my first ever product review. I did not purchase this product from Amazon, but my local Whole Foods market just a couple days ago. Normally I'm not one to do reviews, but since this product is so expensive, I wanted to share my experience.<br /><br />I've been working really hard recently to cut my sugar intake. After reading rave reviews on Amazon about Sweet Tree Coconut Palm sugar, and doing a little research, I debated for 2 weeks, and then decided to just go get some even though it was $5 for a pound. (my health is more important) I started out by using some in my steel cut oats yesterday, which I really liked! I also used it in my coffee yesterday in place of regular sugar, but I noticed little dark things floated to the top. I know it's pretty raw, so I figured, maybe they were little fibers from the tree, or perhaps it was something with that batch of coffee? So I just scooped the little dark floaters out, and drank my coffee. Which tasted pretty good with the palm sugar! I was so pleased, that I was very excited to have my coffee this morning with my new found sweetener.<br /><br />This morning (not more than 10 minutes ago) I made some coffee again with my palm sugar, and before I even had a chance to drink it... more little floaters! As I pushed them to the sides of my white cup, one I noticed for sure had LEGS on it! Yes, my friends... it was a BUG!! I dumped my coffee imediately, and made some more with(unfortunately) my raw organic sugar that I still have. No floaters. So it's definitely not in the coffee... it's in the palm sugar! Has anyone else had an experience/noticed this? I know it's supposed to be healthier and all... but for $5 I'd like my sugar to not have little bugs in it. That's NOT the extra minerals I had in mind! Maybe I just got a bad bag?  It's not my intention to bad mouth this company -- but I would want someone to tell me if they knew I was eating/drinking little bugs. I haven't contacted the company just yet, as I just noticed it for sure this morning. I also looked in the bag that I have, and can see others... one is caked in sugar crystals, so they're hard to notice unless you really look for them.","Tastes good, but there's bugs in mine!",26,31,0.8387096774193549,415,Negative,first ever product review purchase product amazon local whole foods market couple days ago normally im one reviews since product expensive wanted share experiencebr br ive working really hard recently cut sugar intake reading rave reviews amazon sweet tree coconut palm sugar little research debated 2 weeks decided go get even though 5 pound health important started using steel cut oats yesterday really liked also used coffee yesterday place regular sugar noticed little dark things floated top know pretty raw figured maybe little fibers tree perhaps something batch coffee scooped little dark floaters drank coffee tasted pretty good palm sugar pleased excited coffee morning new found sweetenerbr br morning 10 minutes ago made coffee palm sugar even chance drink little floaters pushed sides white cup one noticed sure legs yes friends bug dumped coffee imediately made withunfortunately raw organic sugar still floaters definitely coffee palm sugar anyone else experiencenoticed know supposed healthier 5 id like sugar little bugs thats extra minerals mind maybe got bad bag intention bad mouth company would want someone tell knew eatingdrinking little bugs havent contacted company yet noticed sure morning also looked bag see others one caked sugar crystals theyre hard notice unless really look

4,"I love eating sushi, but ordering from my local sushi place is just too expensive! Also, I'm a vegetarian, so it's hard to find places with a plethora of options, other than the standard avo-cucumber rolls. I decided I wanted to try my hand at making my own sushi, but I was a little nervous about buying the right type of rice, nori, inside ingredients and wasn't sure I wanted to buy a full out kit if I wasn't going to use it very often. I decided this would be a good product that would be that intermediate step - not doing all the work myself, but trying it out nonetheless.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- You can put whatever you'd like inside (I like sweet potato or banana rolls myself!).<br />- Easy to make! Just pop the rice bowl in the microwave, spread some rice on the nori, throw a couple ingredients inside, and you're good to go.<br />- You don't have to have just one type of sushi! I'd rather have 10 pieces, each with slightly different contents than 8 pieces that are exactly the same. This allows me to do such.<br />- Easy to bring for work, and like an earlier reviewer mentioned, a fun conversation starter at lunch! Just chop up a couple veggies, throw them in a zip-lock and ta-da, lunch!<br /><br />Cons<br />- No wasabi. This isn't a big deal for me, as I like my sushi rolls condiment free, but my partner likes his sushi doused in soy sauce and wasabi. It does come with a little soy sauce packet, but that's it.<br />- It's not so much a ""roll"" as a little packet that you delicately have to put together, then shove in your mouth as quickly as possible to prevent it from falling apart. This may be my own ineptness, but I find it a bit tricky to keep together.<br />- I'm not sure you can make inside out rolls (rice on the outside) with this kit. I don't always love the taste of seaweed, but putting a bit of rice on the outside of my ""packet"" and putting that side in my mouth first works a little.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun lunch.

1,"""My family have been gluten free for 10 years now. I also work in the natural products industry at the senior level and have seen the deception first hand. Gluten is quite a serious issue as when it is consumed the villi are inpaired and other nutrients needed to be assimilated for other necessary body functions are not absorbed. It has caused my family other serious complications from eyesight to teeth and mouth difficulties and it has to stop. I am writing this reveiw because I am tired of feeling powerless while companies are prospering at the expense of our health. I follow a paleolithic diet for the most part and recently for my birthday decided to have a turkey sandwich on Udi's bagels. Well they are most certainly not gluten free. EVEN IF LESS THAN 5ppm still makes someone sick. My entire mouth broke out in canker sores and I got a white spot on my front tooth that has not gone away because the gluten sensitivity is preventing iron absorption.

5,"Aloha!<br />""Stay Alert"" ~ 100 milligrams of caffeine: the typical amount of caffeine in two standard 'cokes'<br />OR:<br />""Jolt Caffeine Energy Gum"" ~ 45 milligrams of caffeine: the typical amount in one standard 'coke'<br />PLUS South American Guarana and Ginseng.<br /><br />Matt Gearhart of GumRunners, the makers of ""Jolt Gum"" said he knows U.S. troops are chewing Jolt Gum<br />as opposed to ""Stay Alert"" because of the feedback he receives from them.<br />While Stay Alert by Wrigley boasts a higher caffeine content, Jolt Gum has a dedicated following.<br />Sales of Jolt Gum topped 221,000 packs in the Army and Air Force Exchange System shops worldwide,<br />according to figures provided by AAFES. The gum was most popular at Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan,<br />where nearly 4,100 packs were sold. In fact, combat exchanges accounted for eight of the 10 best-selling<br />locations for Jolt Gum; more than 64,000 packs were sold in war zones in one year. That's still a far cry<br />from sales of the preferred combat zone pick-me-up, Red Bull energy drink, which easily moves more<br />than 30,000 cans at contingency exchanges every week!<br /><br />In war the Tiger never goes away:<br />In the combat zones, our enlisted soldiers live in a state of near-constant arousal with high levels of<br />physical, mental and emotional stress. With an Average Stress Score of 84.61 for a paltry Income of $35,580 living in<br />dangerous conditions with the physical risks and the ever-present threat of death<br />our enlisted soldiers have the dubious 'honour' of having the most stressful job of all.<br /><br />The 'jolt' in ""Jolt Caffeine Energy Gum"" comes from three sources:<br />Caffeine, Ginseng and Guarana.<br /><br />Panax Ginseng* is an ancient adaptogen from China with a warming effect, and is<br />most commonly used by middle-aged and elderly Chinese, especially in winter, for its warming boost.<br />But Ginseng's main health benefit is as a Qi ~ Vital Energy tonic useful in combatting weakness like<br />fatigue, shortness of breath and a low resistance to infections. Ginseng is also an appetite suppressant, a<br />potent natural stimulant, minus the jittery side effects of caffeine, and it enhances<br />memory and cognitive functions.<br /><br />Guarana is a South American Herb that stimulates<br />the brain with slow-release power (but once Guarana kicks in, it works better than caffeine.).<br />Also Guarana doesn't interfere with the sleep process (it actually gives you<br />a better quality sleep over the long haul). Guarana is also non-addictive, relieves stress and<br />anxiety, and increases concentration. Another benefit of Guarana is that it is a diuretic,<br />which can help alleviate fluid retention.<br /><br />Fact: ""Jolt Caffeine Energy Gum"" not only tastes better, it is better for you,<br />and believe me, it beats chewing bitter-tasting freeze-dried coffee!<br />Personal experience:<br />Awesome results for the overnight deadlines rush!<br />Sent from 'on-loan-from-God'-<br />second-hand-awesome Macbook:<br />Excuse brevity, spelling and punctuation:<br />iTyped with my Bi%$#y iThumbs!",Jolt Caffeine Energy Gum ~ Spearmint,0,1,0.0,473,Positive,alohabr stay alert 100 milligrams caffeine typical amount caffeine two standard cokesbr orbr jolt caffeine energy gum 45 milligrams caffeine typical amount one standard cokebr plus south american guarana ginsengbr br matt gearhart gumrunners makers jolt gum said knows us troops chewing jolt gumbr opposed stay alert feedback receives thembr stay alert wrigley boasts higher caffeine content jolt gum dedicated followingbr sales jolt gum topped 221000 packs army air force exchange system shops worldwidebr according figures provided aafes gum popular bagram air base afghanistanbr nearly 4100 packs sold fact combat exchanges accounted eight 10 bestsellingbr locations jolt gum 64000 packs sold war zones one year thats still far crybr sales preferred combat zone pickmeup red bull energy drink easily moves morebr 30000 cans contingency exchanges every weekbr br war tiger never goes awaybr combat zones enlisted soldiers live state nearconstant arousal high levels ofbr physical mental emotional stress average stress score 8461 paltry income 35580 living inbr dangerous conditions physical risks everpresent threat deathbr enlisted soldiers dubious honour stressful job allbr br jolt jolt caffeine energy gum comes three sourcesbr caffeine ginseng guaranabr br panax ginseng ancient adaptogen china warming effect isbr commonly used middleaged elderly chinese especially winter warming boostbr ginsengs main health benefit qi vital energy tonic useful combatting weakness likebr fatigue shortness breath low resistance infections ginseng also appetite suppressant abr potent natural stimulant minus jittery side effects caffeine enhancesbr memory cognitive functionsbr br guarana south american herb stimulatesbr brain slowrelease power guarana kicks works better caffeinebr also guarana doesnt interfere sleep process actually gives youbr better quality sleep long haul guarana also nonaddictive relieves stress andbr anxiety increases concentration another benefit guarana diureticbr help alleviate fluid retentionbr br fact jolt caffeine energy gum tastes better better youbr believe beats chewing bittertasting freezedried coffeebr personal experiencebr awesome results overnight deadlines rushbr sent onloanfromgodbr secondhandawesome macbookbr excuse brevity spelling punctuationbr ityped biy ithumbs

4,"And as the owner of a much-loved dog, isn't that what's most important? So far I've purchased the peanut butter flavor most often because that's my Doberman's favorite, but she's also had the beef flavor and the bacon and cheese (which she hated). So far, no staining on her bedding at all. When she brings one to me that's all slobbery, wanting to play fetch with it, none of the food dye is left behind on me or my clothes either - and she's gone through well over a dozen of this brand of rawhide.<br /><br />One of the things I look for when I buy rawhides for her is if they are completely coated in flavor all the way through, or if they just cover what is visible through the packaging. The reason I do this is because my Dobie is a greedy monster and she will just lick off the goodies and cast aside the rest. So far, with these bones, they have been completely covered and she makes them swiftly disappear.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because the bones that were shipped to my house have always been slightly smaller than advertised. For instance, almost every single 7-8 inch bone I ordered topped out at just a bit over 6 inches. I know it's a small thing, especially if the dog is happy, but she goes through 2-3 of these a week, so it can add up a bit. I just wanted to explain why not 5 stars.

5,"The hot and spicy sauce was apparently created from the fires of Mt.Doom, or some plasma laced meteorite.  I wasn't paying attention when I made the jerky with the hot n spicy, and didn't get the spice/cure evenly applied.

So suffice to say I witnessed my tongue dissolve into thin air as my mouth exploded in pain.  4 bottles of water later, I pulled a tom hanks and was wiping my tongue with a towel.<br /><br />Maybe they took ""spirit of habanero"" and cloned it, intensified it, and poored some sulfuric acid crystals on there for good measure.<br /><br />All kidding aside, the Original is top notch --- I prefer it over any store-bought ready made jerky.

5,"This food is amazing.  When I got my dog she was being fed Canidae.  I saw how clean her coat was and how healthy she looked.  So I went and got the cat version.  My big cat has lost weight and looks the best he has in years.  My little kitten is as healthy as can be.  She is now gaining good amounts of weight, but not getting plump.  It is not like other cat foods that are like McDonalds for pets.  No sudden highs and lows after eating.  I thought pet food was just pet food, but I will never change this food for my pets.

They're trying to make something that tastes like a mojito (which is one of my fave drinks).

It was a refreshing change from the water and sugar free lemonade I'd been downing this past Summer in order to keep hydrated. This one will definitely make it into our rotation, especially during the dog days of Summer here in central Texas.<br /><br />Let me be clear, it doesn't taste as good as a mojito.

4,"I usually make my own flavorings for latte and espresso drinks, but have recently tried to use experiment with different flavored syrups.  My trials have all ended with disappointing results until I tried the Torani flavored syrups.

Even then, the robust flavor of this syrup puts the others to shame.<br /><br />I am very pleased with the sugar free (splenda) vanilla syrup, and have added it as a regular in my line up.  It have even better flavor than when I used real vanilla extract and splenda/sugar on my own.

5,"I will add my kudos. When I opened my first bottle I was not really expecting much. Instead, I was greated by a delicous aroma, followed by a taste of wonderfully sweet, vanilla agave. As the other reviewers noted, this is not just agave syrup with some vanilla extract tossed in: you can see the specks of vanilla bean. I quickly used it in my fat-free ice cream recipe: very good indeed! (next time, however, I will use only the vanilla agave, and ignore putting in any vanilla extract which causes some bitter after-taste).<br /><br />I have given five stars to all three products made by this company.
